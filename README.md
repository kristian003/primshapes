I was fastinated by the pattern when I came across it looking through my design books. It took a bit to figure out but I finally managed to make it work. Adding color was a bit confusing. When I added a fill, it filled all the quad shapes. I'm sure it's a super simple fix! lol... I'll figure it out and resubmit. ~krod.
